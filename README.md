ffqlay
======

Use ffplay as a dll or some other ways(mainly on windows).

If you want to combine ffmpeg with your application,I think this is a good way.but don't forget about the license.

This project is based on ffmpeg 1.1.3,and is clone from http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffqlay/.
The project on sourceforge is based on ffmpeg svn13981 code,I successfully update the code to ffmpeg 1.1.3. 
thanks for your sharing!

The build environment is MSYS+Mingw.

The test project(c#) is also clone from that project, I just fix some little errors so that they can 
run on vs2008.
